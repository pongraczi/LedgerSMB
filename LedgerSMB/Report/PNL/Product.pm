LedgerSMB::Report::PNL::Product - Profit/Loss reports on Products

=head1 SYNPOSIS

 my $rpt = LedgerSMB::Report::PNL::Product->new(%$request);
 $rpt->render($request);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This provides the income statement-like report for products on LedgerSMB on 1.4 
and later.  This report gives decision-makers a general overview of what the 
actual profit and loss of a business is regarding historical performance of 
specific products.

This is only supported on products with inventory because otherwise there is no 
real way to track revenue vs loss, for example with the case of resold services.
